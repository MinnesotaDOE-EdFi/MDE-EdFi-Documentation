## Future Developments
- Looking for details on the Minnesota Common Course Catalogue (MCCC) in Ed-Fi? That documentation is currently being developed during the 2021 school year, in anticipation of implementation during the 2021-2022 school year. In the meantime, the Sandbox environment does have a "preview release" for 2021-2022 for your exploration. MDE is expecting minimal changes between that preview release and the final release.
