# MDE-EdFi-Documentation
This repository contains documentation for Minnesota's implementation of the [Ed-Fi alliance standard](https://www.ed-fi.org/). The Minnesota Department of Education (MDE) is implementing Ed-Fi to help improve the collection of required educational data from Minnesota school districts. Learn more [at MDE's Ed-Fi web page](https://education.mn.gov/MDE/dse/datasub/edfi/) and at the following links:
- [Ed-Fi Technical Documentation](https://techdocs.ed-fi.org/)
- [Ed-Fi Data Standard](https://techdocs.ed-fi.org/display/ETKB/Ed-Fi+Data+Standard)
- [Ed-Fi Operational Data Store (ODS) and API](https://techdocs.ed-fi.org/display/ETKB/Ed-Fi+Operational+Data+Store+and+API)

## Markdown Documentation
In June-July of 2020, MNIT supporting MDE converted much of the 2020-2021 school year documentation to markdown files. While the official documentation remains in Word and Excel within this repository, the markdown files at the top level of this repository represent a pilot of storing and maintaining the documentation in markdown, starting with:

- [SIS and Vendor Test Plan](sis_test_plan_a_toc.md)
- [Sandbox Certification Scenarios](sandbox_cert_a_toc.md)

## Additional Documentation
We will also use this repository to store additional documentation and links that may be useful to Districts and Vendors. See the following:
- [Descriptors and Resources](descriptors_resources.md). This document contains additional information about specific descriptors and data resources that can prove useful in understanding the system.
- [MARSS Translation Guide](https://education.mn.gov/mdeprod/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&dDocName=MDE033371&RevisionSelectionMethod=latestReleased&Rendition=primary). Also known as the "MDE Translation Guide", this document on the MDE website describes the technical specification and definitions used when extracting information out of the Ed-Fi ODS and translating into the data used by the Minnesota Automated Reporting Student System (MARSS).

## Sample Data
JSON files of sample data are being loaded into the [data directory](https://github.com/mn-mde-edfi/MDE-EdFi-Documentation/tree/master/data) in an attempt to assist developers with understanding the Ed-Fi ODS API.

## Issues List
As part of this documentation effort, we are also using Github to manage technical issues. See the [Issue List](https://github.com/mn-mde-edfi/MDE-EdFi-Documentation/issues) for examples.

## Reading with embedded images
If you're reading these markdown files and ```https://github.com/mn-mde-edfi/``` is in the beginning of your browser window, you may have trouble viewing the images embedded in the markdown. You have two options to remedy this: "click through" to view the image in the repository, or view the entire set of markdown documents in [a "web version" of the repository](https://mn-mde-edfi.github.io/MDE-EdFi-Documentation/). (If you see ```https://mn-mde-edfi.github.io/``` in your URL, you are already viewing the web version.)
