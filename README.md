# MDE-EdFi-Documentation
This repository contains documentation for Minnesota's implementation of the [Ed-Fi alliance standard](https://www.ed-fi.org/). The Minnesota Department of Education (MDE) is implementing Ed-Fi to help improve the collection of required educational data from Minnesota school districts. Learn more [at MDE's Ed-Fi web page](https://education.mn.gov/MDE/dse/datasub/edfi/) and at the following links:

- [Ed-Fi Data Standard](https://techdocs.ed-fi.org/display/ETKB/Ed-Fi+Data+Standard)
- [Ed-Fi Operational Data Store (ODS) and API](https://techdocs.ed-fi.org/display/ETKB/Ed-Fi+Operational+Data+Store+and+API)

## Markdown Documentation
In June-July of 2020, MNIT supporting MDE is converted much of the 2020-2021 school year documentation to markdown files. While the official documentation remains in Word and Excel within this repository, the markdown files at the top level of this repository represent a pilot of storing and maintaining the documentation in markdown, starting with:

- [SIS and Vendor Test Plan](sis_test_plan_a_toc.md)
- [Sandbox Certification Scenarios](sandbox_cert_a_toc.md)

## Additional Documentation
We will also use this repository to store additional documentation that may be useful to Districts and Vendors. See the following:
- [Descriptors and Resources](descriptors_resources.md)

## Issues List
As part of this documentation effort, we are also using Github to manage technical issues. See the [Issue List](https://github.com/mn-mde-edfi/MDE-EdFi-Documentation/issues) for examples.
