# MDE-EdFi-Documentation
This repository contains documentation for Minnesota's implementation of the [Ed-Fi alliance standard](https://www.ed-fi.org/). The Minnesota Department of Education (MDE) is implementing Ed-Fi to help improve the collection of required educational data from Minnesota school districts.

## Markdown Pilot
In June-July of 2020, MNIT supporting MDE is testing a conversion of the 2020-2021 school year documentation to markdown files. While the official documentation remains in Word and Excel within this repository, the markdown files at the top level of this repository represent a pilot of storing and maintaining the documentation in markdown, starting with:

- [SIS and Vendor Test Plan](sis_test_plan_a_toc.md)
- [Sandbox Certification Scenarios](sandbox_cert_a_toc.md)
