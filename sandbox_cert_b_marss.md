Enrollment relationship semantics are covered by StudentSchoolAssociation. **MDE allows for the capture of student demographic data by school enrollment.** Therefore, a StudentEducationOrganizationAssociation record must be submitted for each ***school*** in which the student is enrolled to provide the student demographic data provided to the enrolling school by the parent(s). 

**Prerequisite Data**
- Students
- EducationOrganizations (Schools)
